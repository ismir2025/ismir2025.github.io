          This keynote addresses the significance and future vision of the
          convergence of culture and technology in driving the global growth of
          K-Pop. The speaker, founder of SM Entertainment and A2O Entertainment,
          pioneered the concept of
          <span class="highlight-text">"Culture Technology (CT)"</span>, which
          has served as the foundation for the worldwide spread of Korean
          popular culture. CT systematized the entire value chain—from artist
          discovery and training to content production and
          distribution—establishing a framework for artist and IP creation that
          enabled the rise of K-Pop, while also integrating emerging
          technologies into music and content to transform the entertainment
          industry. Through
          <span class="highlight-text">"Zalpha Pop,"</span> the speaker
          envisions a world where humanity connects beyond borders and
          languages, and foresees the emergence of a prosumer-driven ecosystem
          in which fans actively participate as creators rather than remaining
          passive consumers. In a future where artificial intelligence and other
          advanced technologies accelerate the transformation of the
          entertainment landscape, CT will serve as a catalyst to amplify human
          creativity and as the cornerstone of a culturally enriched future
          where culture and technology thrive in harmony. <br /><br />
          <span class="highlight-text">Biography:</span><br />
          Born in 1952, Soo Man LEE made his musical debut as part of the duet
          April and May (4월과 5월) in 1971. He began his solo career in 1974
          and was honored with the MBC Top 10 Singer Award in 1977. In 1978, he
          earned his bachelor's degree from Seoul National University. In 1980,
          he became a prominent media figure, hosting MBC Radio's Starry Night
          (별이 빛나는 밤에) and the MBC TV talk show With Soo-man Lee (이수만과
          함께). He later pursued graduate studies in the United States, earning
          a master's degree in Computer Engineering from California State
          University, Northridge in 1985. In 1989, he founded SM Planning, which
          evolved into SM Entertainment Co., Ltd. in 1995. Under his leadership,
          SM debuted its first idol group, H.O.T., in 1996, followed by the
          debut of solo artist BoA in 2000. He went on to produce and debut
          leading K-pop acts such as TVXQ, Girls' Generation, EXO, NCT, and
          aespa, shaping the foundation of the modern K-pop industry. His
          contributions have been recognized with numerous honors, including the
          Korea Entertainment Arts Development Award (2005), the Producer Award
          at the Golden Disc Awards (2008), the Order of Cultural Merit (2011),
          and Asia's Best Producer at the Top Chinese Music Awards (2016). He
          was also appointed Honorary Ambassador of Los Angeles in 2005 and
          awarded the 'Commanderie de Bontemps' honor from Château Mouton
          Rothschild in 2009. Internationally, he was selected for 'Variety 500'
          by Variety (USA) (2017–2020) and Billboard's Impact List (2020).
          Domestically, he received the K-Pop Contribution Award at the Gaon
          Chart Music Awards (2021). From 2022 to 2024, he served as Visiting
          Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science at
          KAIST. In 2024, he founded A2O Entertainment, continuing his influence
          as one of the most prominent producers and entrepreneurs in global
          entertainment.

          Koreans cry in the mode of their local folk music. When they are sad
          and unable to accept a situation, they cry using only certain notes.
          As they gradually come to terms with reality and reach acceptance or
          compromise, additional notes are introduced. These shifts in tone
          reflect emotional transitions embedded in the act of crying. Among
          traditional Korean musical genres,
          <span class="highlight-text">pansori</span> is a form in which a solo
          performer narrates an epic story while expressing a wide range of
          human emotions through music. In pansori, emotional textures—such as
          denial, anger, sadness, and acceptance—are musically distinct and
          vividly realized. Listeners who share the same musical and cultural
          context often experience deep emotional resonance and immersion. This
          presentation examines how Korean music conveys emotion through the
          musical language of crying. By analyzing the musical and linguistic
          elements associated with different emotional states, we explore how
          sound operates as a shared emotional language in Korean tradition.

          <span class="highlight-text">Biography:</span><br />
          Dr. Hey-Jung Kim (Professor, Master of Music, Ph.D. in Literature) is
          a musicologist and the current president of the Pansori Society. She
          previously served as president of the Society for Korean Folk Songs.
          In her role as professor at Gyeongin National University of Education,
          she is dedicated to training future elementary music educators while
          simultaneously working to preserve and revitalize traditional Korean
          culture. Since the 1990s, Dr. Kim has documented and analyzed orally
          transmitted musical traditions such as Korean folk songs (minyo),
          nongak (farmer's music), and shamanic rituals. Her research explores
          the fluid and evolving nature of oral music traditions. Drawing upon
          extensive field data, she applies statistical and analytical
          methodologies to uncover the underlying principles of musical
          language. Her work involves the complex process of locating
          informants, recording traditional music, transcribing it into
          notation, and analyzing it. Because individual performers interpret
          each song differently, large-scale data analysis is crucial in
          identifying musical universals. Dr. Kim's contributions to the field
          have been widely recognized through academic citations and prestigious
          awards.
