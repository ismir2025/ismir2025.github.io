                Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Harassment of conference participants in any form will not be tolerated. Participants are expected to respect the <span class="highlight-text">privacy protocols</span> of the conference. This Code of Conduct applies to all ISMIR 2025 activities including both physical and virtual events comprising talks, poster sessions, tutorials, workshops, social events, social media, and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

              <p class="section-heading">Harassment</p>
              <p>
                Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, technology choices, English fluency; posting of inappropriate sexual images; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. In the virtual format, harassment also includes disrupting online meetings ("zoom-bombing") and creating unsafe or exclusionary situations.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material, nor sexualized clothing or environments.
              </p>

              <p>
                Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
              </p>

              <p>
                Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
              </p>

              <p>
                We expect participants to follow these rules at ISMIR 2025 conference and satellite venues and conference-related social events.

              <p class="section-heading">Privacy Protocols</p>
              <p>
                Given the hybrid nature of the conference, most scientific sessions will be livestreamed and recorded. The resulting media are only for registered participants and may not be shared without express consent from organizers and participants involved. Providing access to the virtual platform or sharing meeting links with unregistered individuals is prohibited. Do not record or screenshot any ISMIR 2025 activities unless explicit permission has been granted by all participants.
              </p>

              <p>
                Do not take or share screenshots of participants or presenters without explicit permission from everyone present or making sure that participants cannot be identified.
              </p>

              <p>
                Do not share audio or video recordings of ISMIR 2025 besides those released by the conference (via social media or any other means) unless these have been posted with permission by all participants.
              </p>

              <p>
                Do not take or distribute pictures of or copy research posters or presentation materials unless explicitly allowed by the license terms under which these materials are distributed. All ISMIR 2025 presentation videos, posters, and papers are freely available on the conference site.
              </p>

              <p>
                Chat logs can be saved for personal use only.

              <p class="section-heading">Consequences / Enforcement</p>
              <p>
                If a participant engages in harassing or inappropriate behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference (physical venues and virtual platforms) with no refund. Continued or repeated violations will be treated as serious breaches of this Code of Conduct.
