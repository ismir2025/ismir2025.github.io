          Music and musical culture can be understood in many ways, and we believe MIR researchers can benefit from engaging with perspectives beyond our own field. This special session presents distinguished scholars from East Asia who explore musical heritage through diverse and unconventional data sources: from historical gramophone recordings and ancient symbolic notation to cross-cultural datasets of song and speech. By looking outward to these diverse approaches, we hope to deepen our understanding of music and inspire new insights for the MIR community.

          This paper draws on the perspective of transimperial history to demonstrate how Taiwan's unique geopolitical position and Japan's record production model shaped its recording industry and contributed to the creation of new vernacular genres. This not only elevated these vernacular genres from the periphery to the center of Taiwan's record production, but their records' overseas export also transformed Taiwan from the receiver to the creator and disseminator of Hokkien popular culture. It traces the rise of vernacular genres as Taiwan's gramophone industry developed through six stages, discusses how their production strategy created Taiwan's distinctive sounds, sketches out Taiwanese records' export to South China and Southeast Asia, and ends with their legacy after 1945.

          In this talk, I will present Many Voices, a global collaborative research project that pursues the evolutionary origins of singing (and music) through comparison with spoken language, and explores the nature of human vocalizations as manifested in music traditions and languages across societies. Music and spoken language are universally present on the globe, but why have we ended up acquiring these two distinct modes of acoustic communication, regardless of cultural, environmental, or historical differences? To address this question, considering substantial variation in music and language, it is essential to have diverse samples with global collaboration, with traditional music playing a key role in uncovering regularities of music that transcend cultural boundaries. The inquiry into the evolutionary roots of music has been around for a long time since Darwin, and I will discuss how global collaborative work on collecting and analyzing singing and speech contributes to this long-standing debate through presenting results (including preliminary findings) from the Many Voices project.

              Applying MIR to Chinese Guqin Tablature Research: Prospects, Challenges, and Opportunities

          <span class="highlight-text">Abstract:</span><br />
          The Chinese guqin, a seven-string zither with a documented history of over three millennia, preserves one of the world's most extensive and intricate systems of non-staff notation: jianzipu (abbreviated character tablature). Unlike Western staff notation, jianzipu encodes performance instructions—string, finger, stroke, and position—without directly specifying pitch or rhythm. This unique format presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR).
          <br /><br />
          Building on recent research published in Computer Music Journal, this talk explores how Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques can be further applied to the digitization, recognition, and analysis of guqin tablature. Advances in optical music recognition, natural language processing, and symbolic encoding now make it possible to create machine-readable corpora of more than 3,000 guqin scores. Integrating MIR methods with ethnomusicological insight not only helps safeguard an ancient cultural heritage but also reveals broader patterns of melodic structure, transmission, and performance practice.
          <br /><br />
          This study advocates an interdisciplinary dialogue among MIR, computational musicology, and traditional Chinese music, underscoring how technology can advance both scholarship and heritage preservation.
