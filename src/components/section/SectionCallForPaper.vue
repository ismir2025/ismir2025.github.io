          ISMIR 2025 welcomes contributions in all the areas related to Music
          Information Retrieval (MIR) and its applications, including
          computational music analysis, processing, generation, algorithms, and
          their evaluation. ISMIR is a truly interdisciplinary community, which
          fosters collaboration between researchers, developers, educators,
          librarians, students, and professionals from the disciplines involved
          in MIR, such as musicology, cognitive science, library and information
          science, computer science, electrical engineering, and many others.
          ISMIR 2025 will foster the discussion and exchange of ideas among the
          attendees, with special attention to new topics, emerging problems,
          inclusion, and diversity.
          <br /><br />
          The 26th edition of the ISMIR conference carries a special theme:
          <span
            style="
              color: #004191;
              font-style: italic;

              text-decoration: underline;
            "
            >Harmony of Tradition & Modernity.</span
          >
          We encourage diverse perspectives on how MIR can bridge past and
          present, and explore the multifaceted intersections of tradition and
          innovation. From the preservation and analysis of traditional music
          forms to the study of contemporary music trends powered by
          computational methods and data, we welcome submissions that advance
          the understanding of music as a dynamic and evolving cultural force.
          Join us in shaping the future of MIR by engaging with its rich
          historical roots and its ever-expanding horizons.

          ISMIR 2025 will be organized in a hybrid format with the aim of
          enabling both in-person and online participants to engage with the
          conference program and share their work. In-person participation is
          highly encouraged, and the organizing team is committed to helping
          presenters who wish to attend in person do so (regarding e.g., visa
          issues, financial support). Remote presenters will be required to
          attend (online) the specified session of the in-person program to
          which their paper is assigned.
