The title and abstract, together\n          with the selected subject area, are the primary sources for assigning\n          papers to reviewers. So, make sure that they form a concise and\n          complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let\n          someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about.\n          <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Full Paper Submission</span>: The full\n          paper must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline.\n          <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Supplementary Material</span>: For the\n          anonymous review process, in addition to the PDF file of the\n          manuscript, authors may upload supplementary files for their\n          submission, such as audio samples, demonstration videos,\n          self-contained html web pages, code, etc. Submission of PDF files as\n          supplementary material is discouraged. The supplementary materials\n          should comply with the requirements for the double-blind review\n          process. <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Subject Area</span>: When submitting the\n          abstracts, authors will be required to choose from the subject areas\n          given. The list of subject areas is the one listed above and it will\n          be available on the submission site. <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Presenting Authors</span>: At least one\n          author of each accepted paper must register to the conference, before\n          the deadline given for author registration (deadline will be announced\n          shortly). Failure to register before the deadline will result in\n          automatic withdrawal of the paper from the conference proceedings and\n          program. <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Publication</span>: Accepted papers will\n          be published on the conference website and on an open access\n          repository using a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n          License (CC BY 4.0).\n          <br />\n        </v-card-text>\n        <br />\n        <v-divider></v-divider>\n        <br /><br />\n      </v-card>\n      <v-card outlined elevation=\"0\" class=\"pa-4 my-4\">\n        <v-card-title class=\"text-h4 mb-3 font-weight-bold\">\n          Submission Requirements\n        </v-card-title>\n        <v-card-text class=\"text-body\">\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Paper Format</span>: Papers must be\n          formatted using the ISMIR 2025 templates (<a\n            href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/paper-template-for-ismir-2025/xnqdhjhdgsfd\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            style=\"color: #1487c8\"\n            >Overleaf</a\n          >,\n          <a\n            href=\"https://github.com/ismir/paper_templates/releases/tag/2025v1\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            style=\"color: #1487c8\"\n            >LaTeX</a\n          >\n          or\n          <a\n            href=\"https://github.com/ismir/paper_templates/releases/tag/2025v1\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            style=\"color: #1487c8\"\n            >Word</a\n          >). Authors are required to submit their papers in PDF format.\n          Submissions that manipulate the template (e.g., by decreasing margins\n          or font sizes) may be rejected without review. All fonts need to be\n          embedded within the PDF. <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Paper Length</span>: Papers must conform\n          to a 6+N format: 6 pages of scientific content (including figures and\n          tables) and any number of additional pages that contain only\n          references and an optional ethics statement. Overlength papers or\n          papers that do not conform to the required format will be rejected\n          without review. Acknowledgements can be included in the optional pages\n          for the camera ready submission. <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Ethics Statement</span>: With the goal of\n          encouraging more discussion of ethical considerations in the ISMIR\n          research community, authors may now choose to include an ethics\n          statement section in their submissions in addition to the 6 page limit\n          for scientific content. Ethics statements are optional, though they\n          are encouraged especially for work related to MIR technology with the\n          potential for broad social impact, such as recommendation or\n          generation. A good ethics statement should candidly discuss both\n          positive and negative ethical considerations of the work, including\n          but not limited to (1) the potential societal implications of the\n          work, (2) the ethical manner in which the work was conducted\n          (especially for work with user studies), and (3) the prior societal\n          context before the work. Any cultural, economic, or broader societal\n          risks posed by the work should be mentioned (though not necessarily\n          resolved). Ethics statements should be placed directly in the\n          submission PDF and do not count against the 6 page limit for\n          scientific content. Information regarding approval from the\n          Institutional Review Board can also be presented in this section\n          although the names of institutions should be redacted for blind\n          review. In most cases ethics statements would be 0-2 paragraphs, and\n          certainly not longer than a page. <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Accessibility</span>: For this year's\n          submissions, we strongly encourage authors to include alt text (or\n          alternative text) as a first step to make your manuscript more\n          accessible. Please refer to tips and instructions on how to\n          incorporate alt text via\n          <a\n            href=\"https://elearning.adobe.com/2024/02/how-to-add-alt-text-in-adobe-acrobat-a-step-by-step-guide/\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            style=\"color: #1487c8\"\n            >Adobe Acrobat</a\n          >, and\n          <a\n            href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-alternative-text-to-a-shape-picture-chart-smartart-graphic-or-other-object-44989b2a-903c-4d9a-b742-6a75b451c669\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            style=\"color: #1487c8\"\n            >Microsoft Word</a\n          >. Also, we strongly encourage the authors to adopt a color blind\n          friendly color palette when making plots. For Matplotlib users, the\n          'tableau-colorblind10' and 'petroff10' color palettes would be good\n          options, which can be enabled by\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <div class=\"code-block\">\n            <code>\n              plt.style.use('tableau-colorblind10')\n              <br />\n              plt.style.use('petroff10')\n            </code>\n          </div>\n          <br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">Anonymity of Authors</span>: Do not put\n          your names under the title. Avoid using phrases such as \"our previous\n          work\" when referring to earlier publications by the authors. Remove\n          information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments\n          (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs). Check supplementary material for\n          information that may reveal the authors' identity. Avoid providing\n          links to websites that identify the authors.

In the same spirit, to protect our\n          double-blind review process, authors need to make sure they do not\n          promote their work in any way during the review process (social media,\n          blog, mailing-list, etc.), since this may prevent preserving\n          anonymity. <br /><br />\n          <span class=\"highlight-text\">External Materials</span>: If the paper\n          promises to make the code, dataset, or other materials available after\n          the acceptance, our research community relies on the research ethics\n          of the authors to fulfill their promise.\n          <br />\n        </v-card-text>\n        <br />\n        <v-divider></v-divider>\n        <br />\n      </v-card>\n      <v-card outlined elevation=\"0\" class=\"pa-4 my-4\">\n        <v-card-title class=\"text-h4 mb-3 font-weight-bold\"\n          >New-to-ISMIR Paper Mentoring Program\n        </v-card-title>\n        <v-card-text class=\"text-body\">\n          <a\n            href=\"https://ismir2025.ismir.net/new-to-ismir-mentoring-program-2025\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            style=\"color: #1487c8\"\n          >\n            The New-to-ISMIR paper mentoring program\n          </a>\n          is designed for members new to ISMIR to share their advanced-stage\n          work-in-progress ISMIR paper drafts with senior members of the ISMIR\n          community as mentors to obtain focused review and constructive\n          feedback.
