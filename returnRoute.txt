K.ride for Taxi use in Korea
K.ride is a taxi service designed for foreigners in Korea. You can easily register a payment method and use it much like Uber. Since Uber is not widely used in Korea, we recommend using K.ride instead.

T-Money guide for bus and taxi (Phone use)
T-money is a rechargeable transportation card widely used in South Korea for subways, buses, and some taxis. It also works at many convenience stores. You don’t need a physical card anymore—foreigners can now add T-money directly to their smartphone (Apple Pay or Samsung Pay).


1. Getting Started
iPhone (Apple Pay)
Download the Mobile T-money app from the App Store.
Open the app → tap Browsing(둘러보기) (instead of “Start”).
Select the option to add a T-money card to Apple Wallet.
The card will be created in about a minute.
Android (Samsung Pay)
Download the T-money GO app from the Google Play Store.
Follow the prompts to create your digital T-money card.
Add it to Samsung Pay.

2. Adding Money (Top-Up)
Credit Card (Visa/MasterCard): Can be used inside the T-money app (sometimes limited for foreigners; success varies).
Cash at Subway Stations:
Put your phone in Service Mode:
iPhone → Settings → Wallet & Apple Pay → T-money → enable Service Mode.
At a top-up machine in a subway station, place your phone flat on the card reader area.
Insert cash, choose the amount, and wait for the machine to finish reloading.
Your balance will update automatically (sometimes with a short delay).

⚠️ Convenience stores (GS25, CU, 7-Eleven) may not yet support phone reloading smoothly—best to use subway stations.

3. Using T-money
🚍 On the Bus
Tap your phone on the card reader when boarding.
Tap again when exiting (important for transfer discounts).
You can transfer up to 4 times a day at a discount.
🚇 On the Subway
Tap at the gate when entering.
Tap again when exiting.
If you’re transferring within the system, the reader will show 0 KRW charge at entry.
🚖 In a Taxi
Only some taxis accept T-money (Taxi with the T-money logo).
Tell the driver you’ll pay by T-money.
Tap your phone at the card reader when the trip ends.
Make sure your balance covers the full fare in advance
.

4. Tips & Things to Know
Express Mode (on iPhone) means you don’t need to open Wallet—just tap your phone, even if another app is on screen.
Always wait for the beep sound when tapping. Missing a tap may charge you extra.
If an error occurs in the subway, press the Help (red) button at the gate for staff assistance.
Keep your phone flat and steady on the top-up machine when reloading.
Transfers only work if you tap both when boarding and exiting buses or subways.
